ok so, I guess we are making this MVP on FFXIV
lets break down what we have to do. 
1. create a render like we did with the deploymentTEST 
    -Create database (done db name ffxiv)
    -Create tables  (table named minions created)
    -Insert data  (inserted test_data)
    -Initialize npm (created package.json/don't forget "type":"module", ran gitignore ext/created .gitignore) 
    -npm dependencies - express, nodemon, postgres, axios  
    -Create server file (routes.js/ has basic get route for all data.)
    -Connect to our database(connected to local database, pushing to git, made render db/ waiting on success
     now adding database URL to routes.js/ lastly inserting the data from test_data)
     (this is the URL to add files look for -f 
     PGPASSWORD=NmvvR0ExfRM7CT0Bz2aFwa4RthUrL20j psql -h dpg-ceecv29gp3jlc78tipe0-a.oregon-postgres.render.com -U ffxiv_collectables_user -f test_data.sql ffxiv_collectables)
    Create some routes(will return to this after connecting to API)
    Create HTML to make searchbar and search button
    Ensure value from search bar is returned to the console properly
2. connect to our API (https://ffxivcollect.com/)
    run several tests to ensure that we can console.log the data from the URL
    learn and use axios.js to run fetch commands
    create get route- this grabs all minions in user db
    create post route- this posts minion using add button
    create patch route- this will update T/F on minion.owns
    create delete route- this will delete minion in user db. ensure you have a "Are you suer you wish to 
    delete minion alert thingy
    connect all of them between app.js and routes.js
---lets stop here for now--- once this is complete we can write more and move on.
